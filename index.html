    <h1>Population Control: A Sustainable Future</h1>
    <p>Exploring economic and environmental solutions through demographic balance</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As the global population surpasses 8 billion, the strain on Earth's finite resources becomes undeniable. While overconsumption plays a role, sheer population size multiplies environmental damage, economic inequality, and energy demand.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Population Control Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Finite Planet:</strong> Earth's capacity is limited. Sustainable living requires aligning consumption with available resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic Stability:</strong> Fewer dependents per worker eases strain on healthcare, housing, and infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Lower population reduces emissions, deforestation, and water scarcity.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A Personal Perspective from Vietnam</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Vietnam, where the government once implemented a two-child policy to curb rapid population growth. This shift played a key role in improving economic conditions, access to education, and public health. Unlike the U.S., where consumption is the dominant issue, Vietnamâ€™s focus on population helped stabilize development.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Common Myths Addressed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "Population will stabilize on its own."<br><strong>Fact:</strong> Without proactive planning, growth will continue in resource-strained regions.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "Technology will solve everything."<br><strong>Fact:</strong> Innovation helps, but can't offset the impacts of billions more people consuming energy, land, and food.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Population control isn't about limiting freedom; it's about ensuring future generations have access to food, clean air, housing, and stability. It's time to treat it as a serious part of climate and economic policy.</p>
